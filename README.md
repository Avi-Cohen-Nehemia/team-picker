# Team Generator - Technical Challenge

## Background
This App was built as a technical challenge set to us by DevelopMe_, to demonstrate our skills as fresh grduates
We were encourged to get creative and try to develop as many extra features as we can within the given time limit.

## Technology Stack
- React
- Redux

## MVP
The core of the challenge is to create a tool which randomly picks 5-a-side football teams from a list of 10 names.


## Additional features
- [x] Create teams with 3-6 players a side.
- [x] Players have skill level.
- [x] Confirm / ReShuffle teams.
- [x] Cusomizable kits, colours and names.
- [x] Players laid out on an image of a football pitch.
- [x] Keep track of scores and a button to reset them.
- [x] Reset button.


## Future plans / features
- Make the app responsive/mobile-friendly .
- Ability to reshuffle teams fairly based on total skill level.
- Abilty to set winning score which ends the current game automatically.
- Individual delete button for players during the "players-creation" phase.
- Building back-end API to keep track of match history.


## Unresolved issues
- Teams' colors and kits state is stale.


## Reflection

### Tech stack choice
Looking back, leaving my comfort zone and using React/Redux meant I did not finish everything I was plannig to accomplish. However, I'm still glad I chose that tech-stack as it made me learn a lot about React/Redux, and some things I did not understand during the course, now make much more sense.

### Planning
Lack of planning on my part meant that sometimes I struggled more than I should have. I found myself at times, coding all over the place, jumping from a problem to another with no clear roadmap in my head to follow. At the start I did not notice the impact of this kind approach but later I had to face all kinds of issues and bugs that could have been avoided with better planning.

Doing this project was a reminder for me on how important it is to plan before jumping on a problem and starting to code.
