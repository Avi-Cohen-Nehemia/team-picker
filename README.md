# Team Generator - Technical Challenge

## Live Version

## Background
This App was built as a technical challenge set to us by DevelopMe_, to demonstrate our skills as fresh grduates
We were encourged to get creative and try to develop as many extra features as we can within the given time limit.

## Tech Stack / Framworks
- React
- Redux
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- JSX

I chose to tackle this challenge using React/Redux, beacause I felt I am less comfortable using these frameworks. I decided to get out of my comfort zone and take this challenge as an opportunity to sharpen my skills and understanding of React and Redux specifically and my front-end skills in general.

## MVP
The core of the challenge is to create a tool which randomly picks 5-a-side football teams from a list of 10 names.


## Additional Features Implemented
- [x] Create teams with 3-6 players a side.
- [x] Players have skill level.
- [x] Confirm / ReShuffle teams.
- [x] Cusomizable kits, colours and names.
- [x] Players laid out on an image of a football pitch.
- [x] Keep track of teams scores and a button to reset them.
- [x] Reset button.
- [x] Ability to refresh the page and navigate without losing the data.


## Future Plans / Features
- Make the app responsive/mobile-friendly .
- Ability to reshuffle teams fairly based on total skill level.
- Abilty to set winning score which ends the current game automatically.
- Individual delete button for each player during the "players-creation" phase.
- Building back-end API to keep track of match history.


## Known Issues / Bugs
- Teams' colors and kits state is stale.


## Reflection

### Tech Stack Choice
Looking back, leaving my comfort zone and using React/Redux meant I did not finish everything I was plannig to accomplish. However, I'm still glad I chose that tech-stack as it made me learn a lot about React/Redux, and some things I did not understand during the course, now make much more sense.

### Planning
Lack of planning on my part meant that sometimes I struggled more than I should have. I found myself at times, coding all over the place, jumping from a problem to another with no clear roadmap to follow. At the start, when the app was still fairly simple, I did not notice the impact of this approach, but later I had to face all kinds of issues and bugs that could have been avoided with better planning.

Doing this project was a reminder for me on how important it is to plan before jumping on a problem and starting to code.

### Favorite Parts
Even though I did not finish everything I set myself to do, I am very pleased with the result I managed to create during this challenge. I have experienced immense satisfaction every time I got myself to understand a key concept. Overall, doing this project gave me much better understaning of how React/Redux work, which was my personal goal for this challenge from the beginning.

### Least Favorite Parts
Since this project is significant to my future employment opportunities, it became very stressful at times. I had a very hard time to walk away and take proper breaks when I faced difficult problems.
